            <h2 style="margin-top:1.5rem;">1. Keep Your Watch Clean and Dry</h2>
            <p>Regularly wipe your watch with a soft, lint-free cloth to remove dust, sweat, and fingerprints. If your watch is water-resistant, gently clean the case and bracelet with a damp cloth. Always dry thoroughly to prevent moisture buildup, which can damage internal components.</p>

            <h2>4. Store Your Watch Properly</h2>
            <p>When not in use, store your watch in a cool, dry place, ideally in its original box or a dedicated watch case. This protects it from dust, humidity, and accidental knocks. For automatic watches, consider a watch winder to keep the movement running smoothly.</p>

            <h2>5. Avoid Chemicals and Perfumes</h2>
            <p>Chemicals, perfumes, and cosmetics can corrode watch cases, damage leather straps, and dull the finish. Apply such products before putting on your watch, and allow them to dry completely.</p>

            <h2>6. Wind Mechanical Watches Regularly</h2>
            <p>If you own a mechanical watch, wind it regularly—even if you don’t wear it daily. This keeps the lubricants evenly distributed and the movement in good working order. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for winding to avoid overwinding.</p>

            <h2>7. Check and Replace Batteries</h2>
            <p>For quartz watches, replace the battery as soon as it runs out to prevent leakage, which can damage the movement. Have batteries changed by a professional to maintain water resistance and avoid accidental harm.</p>
