        <section class="blog__intro" style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">
            <p>Buying a luxury watch is a significant investment, so it’s essential to ensure authenticity. Counterfeit watches are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but with the right knowledge, you can confidently distinguish genuine timepieces from fakes. Here’s your ultimate guide to spotting a fake luxury watch.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top:1.5rem;">1. Examine the Serial Number</h2>
            <p>Authentic luxury watches have unique, deeply engraved serial numbers. Check the placement, font, and depth—fakes often have shallow, poorly aligned, or missing numbers. Always verify the serial with the manufacturer if possible.</p>

            <h2>2. Inspect the Movement</h2>
            <p>The movement is the heart of any watch. Genuine luxury watches feature precise, smooth movements, while counterfeits may tick unevenly or feel rough. If possible, have a professional open the case back for inspection.</p>

            <h2>3. Analyze the Branding and Logo</h2>
            <p>Look for crisp, clean logos and consistent branding. Counterfeits often have blurry printing, misspelled words, or incorrect logos. Compare with official images from the brand’s website.</p>

            <h2>4. Assess the Weight and Materials</h2>
            <p>Luxury watches are made from high-quality materials and feel substantial in hand. Fakes may use cheap metals or plastics, resulting in a lighter, less solid feel.</p>

            <h2>5. Scrutinize the Packaging</h2>
            <p>Authentic watches come in premium packaging with branded boxes, manuals, and certificates. Poor-quality packaging or missing documentation is a red flag.</p>
